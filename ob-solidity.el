;;; Commentary:

;; Org-babel support for compiling solidity code.
;;
;; Example block:
;; #+begin_src solidity :args --asm --optimize
;;   contract A {
;;   }
;; #+end_src
;;
;; The ":args" field is optional, if provided, it forwards the arguments to "solc".
;;
;; The solc binary is found from the variable `solidity-solc-path`, defined in solidity-mode.

;;; Requirements:

;; solidity-mode https://github.com/ethereum/emacs-solidity.
;;
;; solidity compiler (solc) installed. The path is set at `solidity-solc-path`, defined in the above package (emacs-solidity).
